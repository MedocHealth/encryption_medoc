# 🚧 devtrials.ts Documentation

📑🔙[Back to Index](./index.md)

## 📝 Overview

**⚠️ This module is strictly for development and debugging purposes. It should never be included in production builds and is intentionally not exported.**

The `devtrials.ts` module provides a set of developer utilities and Express routes for inspecting, dumping, and manipulating the database during the development phase. It is designed to help developers debug, snapshot, and interact with the database in ways that would be unsafe or inappropriate in a production environment.

## ⚠️ Development-Only Warning

- **⛔️🚫 Do NOT use this module in production.**
- The routes and utilities provided here can expose sensitive data, allow arbitrary command execution, and bypass security best practices.
- This file is not exported and should be pruned from production deployments.

## 🏗️ Main Components

### 🛣️ Express Route Registration

- The `f(app: Application)` function registers several development-only routes on the provided Express app:
  - `/dev/try/eta`: Estimates time to snapshot the database.
  - `/dev/s`: Returns total database size (excluding system DBs).
  - `/dev/st`: Returns snapshot status.
  - `/dev/d`: Downloads a zipped snapshot of the database.
  - `/k`, `/dk`: Key inspection and decryption test endpoints.
  - `/dev/try/test`: Allows execution of arbitrary shell commands (extremely dangerous, for dev use only).

### 🗃️ Snapshot and Dump Utilities

- Functions to snapshot the database, write collections to files, and zip the results for download.
- Helpers for calculating database size, document counts, and estimated snapshot times.

### 🔑 Key Management and Decryption Helpers

- Functions for inspecting and decrypting Data Encryption Keys (DEKs) for development and testing.

## 🚀 Usage Example

```typescript
import { f } from './devtrials';

// Register dev-only routes (do NOT call in production)
f(app);
```

## 📝 Notes

- This module is intended to be used only during the development phase to aid in debugging and database inspection.
- It exposes sensitive operations and should be removed or disabled before deploying to production.
- The presence of this file in production is a security risk.
